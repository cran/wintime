Description: Performs an analysis of time-to-event clinical trial data using various "win time" methods, 
  including 'ewt', 'ewtr', 'rmt', 'max', 'wtr', 'rwtr', and 'pwt'. These methods are used to calculate and compare 
  treatment effects on ordered composite endpoints. The package handles event times, event indicators, and treatment 
  arm indicators and supports calculations on observed and resampled data. Detailed explanations of each method and 
  usage examples are provided in "Use of win time for ordered composite endpoints in clinical trials," by Troendle et al.
